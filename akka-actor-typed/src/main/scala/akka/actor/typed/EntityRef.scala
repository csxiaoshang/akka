/**
 * A reference to an sharded Entity, which allows `ActorRef`-like usage.
 *
 * An [[EntityRef]] is NOT an [[ActorRef]]–by design–in order to be explicit about the fact that the life-cycle
 * of a sharded Entity is very different than a plain Actors. Most notably, this is shown by features of Entities
 * such as re-balancing (an active Entity to a different node) or passivation. Both of which are aimed to be completely
 * transparent to users of such Entity. In other words, if this were to be a plain ActorRef, it would be possible to
 * apply DeathWatch to it, which in turn would then trigger when the sharded Actor stopped, breaking the illusion that
 * Entity refs are "always there". Please note that while not encouraged, it is possible to expose an Actor's `self`
 * [[ActorRef]] and watch it in case such notification is desired.
 * Not for user extension.
